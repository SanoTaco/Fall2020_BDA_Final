We used this dataset(xAPI-Edu-Data) to analyze the data and visualize it to predict student achievement by analyzing the data and developing a model.

## Research Steps
Data pre-processing->data visualization->model building analysis->parameter tuning->prediction effect

## Environment
Python 3.7 + Jupyter Notebook

Required Packages: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy.
